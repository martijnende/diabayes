# Rock friction experiments

This section briefly summarises a few key concepts in rock friction experimentation, which are presumed to be well understood for the remainder of this User Guide.

- Effective friction coefficient (ignoring friction)

## Velocity-step tests

- Up and down steps

## Stick-slip instabilities

## Slide-hold-slide tests
