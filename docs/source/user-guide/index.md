# User Guide

This guide aims to provide more theoretical background on the various methods that are used, as well as their implementation in DiaBayes. If you are considering to develop new features, or if you simply wish to understand how things work, this is a good place to start.

The guide is not structured in a particular order, and so it is not necessarily meant to be read from top to bottom. The individual chapters will contain occasional cross-references to other chapters if prior knowledge is assumed.
